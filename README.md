# CanucksArmy

These are the Python scripts that we use to scrape NHL data at CanucksArmy. This repository will be maintained with bug
fixes, but will not receive new features. Future development will happen at
[CanucksArmy.js](https://github.com/dsgkirkby/CanucksArmy.js).

## Getting Started

To run the python scripts, you must have the following installed:

- Python 3.5 https://www.python.org/downloads/release
- Git https://git-scm.com/download/win

Then, follow these steps:

1. Run Git Bash, the bundled shell that comes with Git
2. Navigate to a directory where you would like to store the files
3. Clone the repository `git clone https://github.com/NoNeedToBail/CanucksArmy.git`
4. Navigate to the root of the cloned repository
5. Install the python requirements `pip install -r requirements-stable.txt`
6. You can now run the scripts! Run `python main.py -h` to get started!
